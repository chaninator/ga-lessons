### Opening Framing

#### What
HTML is the markup language used to create web pages.

#### Why
HTML elements are the building blocks of the world wide web.

### I do, we do, you do
Notes: 
* Periodically check for understanding as we go along
* Scaffold the exercises to increase in complexity
* Make students do the heavy lifting, ask plenty of questions

**Class Question**
