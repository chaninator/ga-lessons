### Class Culture

* Collaborative, not competitive
* **Learning to learn** vs. learning to memorize
* Self guided learning; take the initiative
* What you put into this course is what you get out of it
* Be good to your classmates, they're part of your network
* Participate! Public speaking and sharing your thoughts are a huge part of being a developer, practice now while you're in a safe environment with people who want to help you

### The Emotional Cycle of Change

### Graduation Requirements

- Not absent more than 3 days
- Arriving late 4 times is counted as an absence
- 80% of homework completed

It's imperative that you're in class and on time; everything we do in the course builds on itself, so missing even a little bit sets you back in the future as well.

### Messaging and Communication

- For informal communication that doesn't need to be private, use Slack - even if you think it's a silly question, someone else probably has the same question
- If you need to talk to the instructors privately, please Slack the instructors in your private channel or bring it up during 1-on-1's
- If you have a code question, make sure you've Googled the problem, you've tried to implement a couple of solutions, and you've asked another student; then, if it's not solved, come to the instructor with a well formed question
