#### Why is it important to go mobile first? 

In early 2014, mobile internet usage surpassed PC internet usage for the first time. Most of this is traffic from apps, but easily shows how important designing for mobile is. 

Earlier this year, Google stopped displaying websites that are not mobile friendly in mobile search results.  

In the US:

* 94% of users search for local information on their phones. Nearby restaurants, directions, etc. 
* 77% of all mobile searches are done at home, where the user also has access to their PC

#### How do you make websites mobile friendly?

* Figure out the main objectives for the site and make it easy for them to accomplish these objectives 
* Use a responsive web design that lays out content optimized for the current screen size
* If the user has to pinch/zoom to view content, then it's not considered mobile friendly
* Keep users in one browser window, it can often be difficult to navigate back
* Even better, keep them on the same page and minimize full page loads when possible
* Do not use fixed width elements

#### Differences between a responsive website and a mobile-specific website

**Responsive Web Designs**
Automatically adapts and adjusts itself to the available viewing area

PROS
* One website and codebase for multiple devices - easier to maintain 
* One website url, no redirects to something like m.facebook.com
* Lower cost of development - 1 website instead of 2

CONS
* You're trying to optimize the UX for two very different platforms
* Some older devices and browsers won't present the design as you'd expect

**Mobile Specific Website**

PROS
* User experience is optimized for both platforms. Fully takes into consideration the benefits and downsides of each platform
* Speed - No downloading any unneccessary code, page will load faster 

CONS 
* Cost - More expensive to maintain two sites 
* Multiple URL's. User has to know both URL's or more likely have to wait for a redirect which will delay the process a couple of seconds
