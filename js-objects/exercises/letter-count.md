# Letter Count

**15 min**

Create a function `letterCount` that accepts a string, and finds the number of times each letter
occurs in the string. For example, given the word "apple", `letterCount('apple')` should count all
occurrences of the letters "a", "p", "l" and "e" and then return the following output:

```javascript
{
  "a": 1,
  "p": 2,
  "l": 1,
  "e": 1
}
```
  
**Bonuses**
  
- Make sure that lower case letters and upper case letters count for the same character.
- Ignore spaces, special characters, and punctuation
