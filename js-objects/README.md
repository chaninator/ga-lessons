## What

## Why

From Eloquent JavaScript:

> Numbers, Booleans, and strings are the bricks that data structures are built from. But you can’t make much of a house out of a single brick. Objects allow us to group values—including other objects—together and thus build more complex structures.

If we want to write code of any complexity, we are going to need to understand objects, how to create them, how to manipulate them, how to access data within them, and how to think about them.
