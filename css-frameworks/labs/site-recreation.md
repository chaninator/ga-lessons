**Objective:** In pairs, pick any site that you want and re-create the landing page (i.e. homepage) of the site using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## Getting Started

1. [Create a new repository on GitHub](https://github.com/sf-wdi-34/schedule/blob/master/how-to/create-a-new-repo.md). Add your teammate as a collaborator. You should both clone the repo down to your local machine.

2. Choose a site, and start by drawing a simple wireframe of its layout.

3. Your focus should be on re-creating the layout of the website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. You should leverage Bootstrap's grid system and componenents. First, create a static page. If you see any simple functionality that you want to mimic, work on that after you've finished the layout and styling.
