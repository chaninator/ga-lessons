## Introduction: Grids (10 mins)
### Why use a CSS grid?

#### Structure
* Grids are a simple way to apply layout to a webpage. A better layout improves the user experience.
* Grids help avoid stressful CSS debugging by starting out on the right foot.

#### Reusability
* Grids make the layout process easier because of reusable, semantically-named "utility classes" (i.e., a library of CSS class selectors).
* Grids aren't limited to a particular project. We can apply them to pretty much everything we do.
* Grids are highly customizable. You can really make them your own.

_Even if you don't use a grid system, these concepts will translate across other layout problems._

### Basic components of a grid

#### Rows
* The highest-level component of a grid.
* Comprised of columns.

#### Columns
