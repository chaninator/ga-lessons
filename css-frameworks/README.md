# CSS Frameworks

### Learning Objectives

* Describe the benefits of using responsive design
* Describe what it means to go mobile first
* Explain the difference between a responsive website and a mobile-specific website
* Create a responsive layout that adjusts according to the screen/window size
* Explain how a grid system works

## Introduction: Grids (10 mins)
### Why use a CSS grid?

#### Structure
* Grids are a simple way to apply layout to a webpage. A better layout improves the user experience.
* Grids help avoid stressful CSS debugging by starting out on the right foot.

#### Reusability
* Grids make the layout process easier because of reusable, semantically-named "utility classes" (i.e., a library of CSS class selectors).
* Grids aren't limited to a particular project. We can apply them to pretty much everything we do.
* Grids are highly customizable. You can really make them your own.

_Even if you don't use a grid system, these concepts will translate across other layout problems._

### Basic components of a grid

#### Rows
* The highest-level component of a grid.
* Comprised of columns.

#### Columns
* Contain and separate site content.

#### Gutters
* Provides spacing between our columns. Optional, but useful.

## Introduction: Bootstrap (20 mins) (If Time Permits)

Many workplaces use an extablished grid system, such as [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) or [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/).

Bootstrap is "the most popular HTML, CSS and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web."

Features:

1. Grid system
1. Forms/buttons
1. Navigation
1. Tabs and pills
1. Alerts/error messages
1. Modals
1. And much more

Today we will be taking a look at the grid system that Bootstrap provides. 

Take a look at the [Bootstrap Expo](http://expo.getbootstrap.com/) site to see some examples of sites that use Bootstrap.

#### Setup

To add Bootstrap to a project:

1. Download Bootstrap [here](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/)
2. Once downloaded, unzip and open folder in Finder. Youâ€™ll see something like this:
	
	![](assets/bootstrap_files.png)
3. Move the `bootstrap.css` file (and any other files you want to use) into the `css` folder in your project
4. Add a `<link>` tag in the head of your page to include the file:
	`<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/bootstrap.min">`
		

#### How it works

Bootstrap includes a responsive, mobile-first fluid grid system that appropriately scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases.

Page layouts are created through a series of rows and columns that house your content.

Similar to the grid system we created together in class, Bootstrap includes predefined classes for easy layout options:

#### Steps to use Bootstrap

1. Bootstrap requires a containing element to wrap site contents and house our grid system. You may choose one of two containers to use in your projects:
	- Use `.container` for a responsive fixed width container.
	
		```css
		<div class="container">
			...
		</div>
		```
	- Use `.container-fluid` for a full width container, spanning the entire width of your viewport.

		```css
		<div class="container-fluid">
		  ...
		</div>
		```
2. Add rows
	- Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns.
	- Only columns may be immediate children of rows.
	
	```css
	<div class="container-fluid">
		<div class="row">
			(columns)
		</div>
	</div>
	```
3. Add columns
	
	```css
	<div class="container-fluid">
		<div class="row">
		  <div class="col-md-5">.col-md-5</div>
		  <div class="col-md-7">.col-md-7</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
		  <div class="col-md-4">.col-md-4</div>
		  <div class="col-md-4">.col-md-4</div>
		  <div class="col-md-4">.col-md-4</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	```

#### Independent Practice

Open [starter-code/bootstrap](starter-code/bootstrap) in your text editor. 

1. Take a look at grid.png.
2. Recreate the grid in your HTML.
	- You should not need to add any CSS!

#### Bootstrap vs. Custom Grid System

Discuss the following question with a partner:

When might it be better to use an established grid system, such as Bootstrap? When might it be better to use a custom-made grid system?
