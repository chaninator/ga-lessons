### Opening Framing
#### What

HTTP is the foundation for data communication on the world wide web. It defines the set of rules used to send text, images, videos on the web.

#### Why

The rules provided by the HTTP protocol are important because they allow us to transmit web documents, images, videos in a standardized and reliable manner. 

### Differentiate between the internet and web

The internet is a network of networks that connect millions of computers together globally. It allows any computer to connect to any other computer as long as they are both connected to the internet. The world wide web is built on top of the internet, and it's one way of accessing information on the internet. Using HTTP, this is how we access web documents, images, and video on the web. 

### How the internet works, including what a web server is and what a client is

### What are protocols?

Protocols define rules and a standard way of doing things. 

Example: 
Meeting a famous actor 

- Act really surprised
- Tell them you're their biggest fan
- Say you've seen all their movies at least 20 times
- Get their autograph
- Tell your friends that you're best friends with them
