## Topic
Events and event handling

## What
Actions that are generally out of our control like user interactions and web pages being fully loaded result in DOM events to give developers a chance to respond to them. Event handlers are functions that capture these events and take action on them.

## Why
So that we can create richer and more interactive web experiences than we could be able to without them.
